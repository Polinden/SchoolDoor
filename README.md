The first Android part of the School access control system. The System provides a Form master with daily info about late arrival and truancy of students. This Android app scans ID cards (bar codes), puts records in a queue and then sends it (asynchronously) to a REST-server for futher processing. The REST-server and so on is introduced in the second part of Form Master Helper (Server part). This first Android part uses Spring for Android and ZXing Library for barcode scanning.
