# School access control system

- The System provides a formmaster with daily info about late arrival and truancy of students 
- The Android app scans ID cards (bar codes), puts records in a queue and then sends it (asynchronously) to a REST-server for futher processing 
- The basic REST-server is included
- The Android part uses Spring for Android and ZXing Library for barcode scanning
